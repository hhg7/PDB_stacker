# PDB_stacker
takes a time directory of PDB files and shows stacking percentage as a function of time.  This is great for packages like AMBER.  This program was first used to study [RNA tetramers]{http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct501025q} and has been used also to study [compaction of duplex nucleic acids]{http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00084}
